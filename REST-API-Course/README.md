# Ensembl REST API Workshop

This folder contains completed exercises from an **Ensembl REST API** workshop.  
The workshop introduced how to programmatically query the Ensembl genome database using Python.

## Overview
The Ensembl REST API allows retrieval of genomic data (genes, transcripts, variants, sequences, etc.) directly via web requests, without manually downloading large datasets.

In this notebook, I learned how to:
- Send HTTP requests to the Ensembl REST API using Python.
- Retrieve data in JSON format and parse it.
- Automate queries for multiple genomic IDs.
- Link to other REST APIs.

## How to Use
Download the jupyter notebook. It should run fine on a local PC. I used Google Colab.
